# Playwright, TypeScript, and pnpm Usage

This project uses [Playwright](mdc:https:/playwright.dev) for end-to-end testing, with all tests and page objects written in TypeScript.

- Playwright test files are located in the `tests/` directory and use `.ts` extensions.
- Page Object Model (POM) classes are in the `pages/` directory and are also written in TypeScript.
- The project uses [pnpm](mdc:https:/pnpm.io) as the package manager. All dependencies should be installed and managed using pnpm commands (e.g., `pnpm install`, `pnpm add <package>`).
- Do **not** use `npm` or `yarn` for dependency management in this repository.

## Example Commands

- Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
- Add a new package: `pnpm add <package>`
- Run Playwright tests: `pnpm exec playwright test`

Refer to [package.json](mdc:package.json) and [pnpm-lock.yaml](mdc:pnpm-lock.yaml) for dependency management details.
